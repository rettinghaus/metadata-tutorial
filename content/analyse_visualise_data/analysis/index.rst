Basic Statistical Analysis
==========================

The number of potential analysis methods that can be applied to your data is vast and exceeds what can be covered here, we will thus focus on basic descriptive and comparative statistics. Even in these two areas there is more than can be covered here, so this should really only be treated as a first analysis step.

For the actual analysis we will use `Pandas`_ to store the data and `SciPy`_ for the statistical analysis. This is not something that is that important at this point, but both libraries provide a lot more functionality that can potentially be applied to your data, so you might want to explore their documentation.
