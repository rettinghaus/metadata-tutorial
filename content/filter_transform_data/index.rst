Filtering & Transformation
==========================

Whether you fetch the data from an OAI-PMH server, a specific API like Europeana, or have the data available locally, the next step in working with the data is to filter out those records that are of no interest and transform the interesting records into the required format for analysis and visualisation.

While the tutorial will first look at filtering and then at transforming, in practice it is more common that these two steps are performed alternatingly and repeatedly in order to produce the final data-set for analysis.
